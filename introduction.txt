# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Ahmed Khaled. I’m currently a geology student at Al-Azhar University. I’m passionate about learning new technologies, especially Git and GitHub. I love photography, fitness, and working on meaningful projects that can have an impact.

I’m working on improving my English, coding skills, and personal growth to become a global citizen. This is my first step into the world of collaborative coding.
